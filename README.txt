## Simple file sending service using python and C.

##Instructions:

Upload three files to the directory of your choice, server.cpp, makefile, and client.py

compile the server using "make server"

To run it, simply type ./main <port number>

For client.py, simply run it by typing python client.py <server address> <portnumber>

## requirements for this project

• ftserver must be written in C/C++.
• ftclient must be written in Java or Python.
• Of course, your program must be well-modularized and well-documented.
• You may not use sendfile or any other predefined function that makes the problem trivial.
• Your program should be able to send a complete text file.  You are not required to handle an “out of memory” error. Separate grading for short text files and long text files.
• Use the directories in which the programs are running.  Don't hard-code any directories that might be inaccessible to the graders.
• If you use additional include-files or make-files, be sure to hand them in with your program.
• Create a README containing detailed instructions on how to compile and run your server and client.
• Don’t ZIP things up, you should only be submitting 5 files, maximum. I don’t want your whole directory structure (Mac people).
• Be absolutely sure to cite any references and credit any collaborators. I’m sick of giving failing grades for people not doing this.
